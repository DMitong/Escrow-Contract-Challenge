# Escrow Smart Contract

## Background

The smart contract in this repository is part of a 15 day smart contract building challenge. The challenge has three levels of difficulty, namely:

- Basic: The challenges from Day 1 to Day 5
- Intermediate: The challenges from Day 6 to Day 10
- Advanced: The challenges from Day 11 to Day 15

## Challenge Task: Basic 5

Write a smart contract that can implement a simple escrow service. The contract should have a struct that stores the details of each transaction, such as the buyer, seller, amount, and status. The contract should also have a function to allow the buyer to initiate a transaction, by sending the amount to the contract. The contract should also have a function to allow the seller to confirm the delivery of the goods or services. The contract should also have a function to release the funds to the seller, only if the buyer approves the transaction.
